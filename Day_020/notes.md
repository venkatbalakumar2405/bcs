# class and function are same only in case of javascript alone
# TC 139 -class embodied over 
# pending
- if resolve not given it will start to be in pending and it will go to web API incase of asynchronous function
- webapi  waits for time 
- setout will comes first in accordanc to priority
- concept based logic need to understand
- call back queue-2 queues just like normal line and higher priority line,Event loop will try to push when the call stack is empty so it pushes which higher priority
- in general promise have high priority
- Even handlers 
-live reload enabled will depends on the web api  reloading time
-Web api means rest API
- general API -standard interface for communicated between two software systems like port connecting usb and devices.
- API- both front end and backend - REST API
- multiple lens can fit multiple sony like camera products which the interface has been standardized
# Real Time example implementations
- "MCP"- it is related to AI  just like common interface called MCP -exposing functions of anukkal to MCP related as port  so it can be functions called in SAP through anukkal -automation process can be simplified .
- MCP exposed through MCP will be understood by Chatgpt and it will accessed 
# Continuing to the topic REST API
- Go -language of back end of google
- html ,css -presentation
- react ,jaavscript - front end
- API-( post ,get,delete,put )-CRUD operations-all language understands
- REST API-JSON language -
- like eg:- servlet used to create backend in java ,eg morse code usages in war 2 for standardized usages
- JSON.stringify(student)-you cannot represent the function in json only objects can be used in JSON
- type of  data -string 
- data - similary to object but not object so it returns undefined
- data.name -- returns undefined
- JSON.parse(data)- valid data
- normal object : but in json should be given in double quotes-rule in json but not number as well boolean,if boolen and number given in  quotes it will convert to string 
- JSONlint.com -website
- Each language understands the string so it uses json as common language
- Json language used the language power like dictionaries in python ,hashmap in java-
- Advantage of REST API -web apps -mobile  app - kotlin for android language,swift for ios
- Multiple back end can be used for RESTAPI  for front end  as external backend
- 80% node js and 20 % GO language - two different backendlanguages 
- /users -node js -devops like url
- soap API was old version like xml used in soap
