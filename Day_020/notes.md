# class and function are same only in case of javascript alone

# TC 139 -class embodied over

# pending

- if resolve not given it will start to be in pending and it will go to web API incase of asynchronous function
- webapi waits for time
- setout will comes first in accordanc to priority
- concept based logic need to understand
- call back queue-2 queues just like normal line and higher priority line,Event loop will try to push when the call stack is empty so it pushes which higher priority
- in general promise have high priority
- Even handlers are also asynchronous functions
  -live reload enabled will depends on the web api reloading time
  -Web api means rest API
- general API -standard interface for communicated between two software systems like port connecting usb and devices.
- API- both front end and backend - REST API
- multiple lens can fit multiple sony like camera products which the interface has been standardized

# Real Time example implementations

- "MCP"- it is related to AI just like common interface called MCP -exposing functions of anukkal to MCP related as port so it can be functions called in SAP through anukkal -automation process can be simplified .
- MCP exposed through MCP will be understood by Chatgpt and it will accessed

# Continuing to the topic REST API

- Go -language of back end of google
- html ,css -presentation
- react ,jaavscript - front end
- API-( post ,get,delete,put )-CRUD operations-all language understands
- REST API-JSON language -
- like eg:- servlet used to create backend in java ,eg morse code usages in war 2 for standardized usages
- JSON.stringify(student)-you cannot represent the function in json only objects can be used in JSON
- type of data -string
- data - similary to object but not object so it returns undefined
- data.name -- returns undefined
- JSON.parse(data)- valid data
- normal object : but in json should be given in double quotes-rule in json but not number as well boolean,if boolen and number given in quotes it will convert to string
- JSONlint.com -website
- Each language understands the string so it uses json as common language
- Json language used the language power like dictionaries in python ,hashmap in java-
- Advantage of REST API -web apps -mobile app - kotlin for android language(linux basically),swift for ios
- Multiple back end can be used for RESTAPI for front end as external backend
- 80% node js and 20 % GO language - two different backendlanguages
- /users -node js -devops like url
- soap API was old version like xml used in soap

# advantage of RESTAPI

- Loose coupling
- front end -><- Back End- are not affected by updating vice versa -front end and backend can be changed independantly
- multiple backend and multiple front end can be connected
- multiple backend( known as microservices)
- RESTAPI -cross platform-linux,mac and windows all applicable
- microservice architecture--> 2 or 10 backends but works on 1 front end
- cart backends connectivity to backends
- microservice multiple backends -netiflex has succeeded as pioneers
- so individual updates will be done independantly devoid of other backends -used in microservices
  -GRCP - backend to backend- just like rest API
- microservices is used in cloud but not a cloud concept
- three layer architecture-front end and backend and database
- can be structure like array of objects or object of arrays ,json can be in any structure but it gives string
- json.parse - array of objects in response
- REST api's free github- public api
- token -Oauth- continuous 30 times -backend server will block
- Deepseek needs powerful graphic card to install
- https://maps.olakrutrim.com/ - using ola for 1year
- api.chuknorris.io/jokes/random
- RESTAPI endpoint- where called we will get the endpoint -api endpoints as like link which gives json
- fetch always returns promises
- asynchronous await-looks like synchronous
  -- when promise is returned it should be replaced by await
- res.json
- parse -json ->object
- All asynch function return promise
- await must always inside asynch functions
  --top level- await
- type script ="module"- it changes the entire function into asynch and it will await can be used ,top level await
- await must be put in order to return asyn function
- how to handle multiple promises
- promise .all to handle all the promises at a stretch
-  array ,array of promises with n number of fetches -multiple promises will be fired at same time
- promise .all maintain the same order  will wait until the data gets merged from array  
- concurrent
- case 2 : but if anyone gets rejects ,totally is rejected: it will return uncaught in promise
 but if catch then error message will be displayed as error is handled
 - promise.race  which comes fast will comes faster but willnot get merged 
 - for user experience ,it comes faster
 - if second one is rejected ,then the first one who comes first will get displayed
 - if first one is rejected ,then  the entire things gets rejected
 # Assignment:-
 -promise .all selected
 -mockapi.io--CRUD operations like to do operations
