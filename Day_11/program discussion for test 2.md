# Day-1 -intro
# introduction to  browser
### what language does the browser understand?
>Note:Although chrome is built on c++ it does not understand it
>firefox was built on Rust language 
-CSS
-HTML
-JS   
#Multiple types of Engine
-Rendering 
- Parses HTML AND CSS
(nested)
-chrome :Blink
-JS ENGINE
-parses javascript
-chrome :v8
# SHORTCUTS
- alt+ UP-->MOVE LINES UP AND DOWN
# BACKTICK`
- `alt +â¬†`  ->move lines up and down
-. to convert into dev in github
- win+.`->Emoji

## web application -dynamic response
## website-static response
# # browser using 
## kotlin -android
# ios mobile-shift
#web app is not  needed to download ,don't need to update and works on cross platform
# three layer architecture
# Front -End ,back-ENd,database
# chrome-javascript,react script,backend-flask-python,sql
#html-skeleton,css-makeup,javascript-brain
#css-developer tools -rightclick-inspect-devtools-network-refresh the screen-blcok request url of css - to remove css
# unblock url-css
#json are medium of data transfer
#in front end react js and angular may be differ but the backend will not change
#go- developed by  google
#loose coupling to separate front end and back end
#javascript is basic and react 
#webpack plus babel is the translator to change the react js
#code reusablity 
#developer experience dx
#user experience ux
#foundation is similar to javascript as hammer  and hammer for react js
# index .html is the request  to server and client
# server is a pc
# google is a html file by request and response cycle
# fetch resources 
# Decompress,parse/compile ,render
# Domain name system
# square space ,hosting ,godaddy
# phising attack for facebook.in
# authorized  squatting 
# contact as like as DNS as like ip address.
# from ip address to google ip address.
# ip address is like  a mobile number ipv4  and ipv6
# assigning every grain of sand like ipv 6 addresses
# public and private static and dynamic
# vpn virtual private number  ISP  
# private line like since it is permanent  and static is costlier
# dynamic 
# public and private  ip ,public ip is assigned as well private ip  while private ip is assigned from router
# DNS -google has ip address public and privateip is also assigned for internal 
# mac address - physical address on network adapter 
# vpn is connected to another computer and 
# linked in profile and git hub profile  and also recap of afternoon sessions
# we were changing some css files in websites  as a takeaway
# war between IE and Mozila firefox
# inbuild and default by microsoft for IE and netscape was for price
# brand 
# toolbars and IE was bad user experience
# white labelling,chromium based browsers
# webpack and babble will come to convert the javascript flask 
# dx -developer experience will be better in react
# inspect-network -devtools-network panels-css -elements panel
# domain name providers
# domain name server
# automize will seek the response 
# public ip will act as passport and private ip will act as adhaar
# CDN Server---keeping the copy in multiple places
# will connect with ISP 
# ip behind google address 
# when :80 port 80 is accessed 
# RJ45 is mean't for ethernet port
# software  access the port as like service
# task manager-process
# running program is a process
# web server seems to run in another computer in 80 port or 443 port
# 22 port another computer can be controlled
# 440 port https is secured connection
# Each service runs in the port
# default port services.
# File transfer protocol like google drive like ftp server port must be opened 
# putty is used for Secure shell (SSH)
# DNS convertso domain name into ip address
# both client and server has an ip address
# router setticng can be used any ip address the speed of downloading
# mac address - can be used to set the  ip address from router 
# Connecting with another router wan port and lan port
# coloured port is wan port and second router will work as switch
# transmission control protocol
# connection  is stable -TCP handshake-Three way handshake handshake is inititiated
# synch hi Ack Hi ,Ack ack HI
# UDP works with live streaming.
# real time example is whatsapp for TCP
# smtp is tcp
# UDP IS AN EXAMPLE OF TEAMS
# FOR THREE HANDSHAKE AFTER STABLE CONNECTION
# FOR EACH UDP 
# SUBMARINEE OFC CABLES OPTICAL FIBER CABLE
# 8th layer is important as total internal reflection

## CSS -
<!-inline ,--internal or embedded CSS ,external  CSS>

<--text styling--font -size ,font-weight ,font -style>

<--font family>
<--color>---no font color or text color only color
##  1px -dot in screens*/ = 4 dots in mac and will be done with scaling other than normal

p{
  font-size= 18 px;
  /default value *-400*/
  font-weight:bold;(600 or 700)  default values
  font-style:Italic
  (!-- generally normally paragraph should not be Italic only  quotes should be represented by italic )
}
## 
  <p> </p>
<!----paragraph selector is also known as element selector>
class   was included 
.highlight-- can be used for highlighting  as class selector
withour dot is known as element selector
once declared is enought and can be reused 
 hobbies can be used 
 go to inspect and in elements and in styles  and when unchecked it will remove the color
 RCB :- or can be used as in hexadecimal format
 and a can be used for transparency last will be overriden 
 unicode was used for  emoti not for color
 0-9a-f   rgb  if all color is mixed it will be white if not it will be black
  in according to the rgb values the maximum values will be 255
  HSL - hue saturation lightness
  boosing the base color is saturation ,new colors are used shown based on background
  if saturation is zero it will become grey and when  increased it will boost the coloru
  --human friendly
  lightness -when it is 100 percent it will vanish and when it is zero it  black 
  hue-  color alone will change so chose different colors
  all colors will have difference in saturation and lightness for every unique colors
  colors that are new and released in new colors srgb is color gamettter  srgb - the picture  that should be displayed in theatre  with color correction  so monitors  with billions of color  supported as srgb - collection of colors -- only 240 were default so bunch of colors are introduced in browsers
-- gammetter -color range of colors --SRGB --100 % supported in monitor need to be understood -DCpi is bigger than srgB   to match with browser  and it will be show the nearest margine for colors not found 
//syntax  and structure -revise
//color paletter and word highlight and image with extensibility  and arrow marks  for presentation tips in ppt and need to  be incorporate in next ppt
// polyline - used to draw with shift options extra slides with content and images without  paragraph contents
//filter function only accepts predicate functions -will return boolean datatype ,filter ,sum and every will return boolean data type
//flow need to be understood gradually
Every returns true and false while filter returns true and ignores the false items for the condition
filter will not change the data type since objects will be returned
every,sum and includes are default functions  and logical functions  and use custom funcctions that return boolean can also be included that return  boolean 
[] -empty array is not falsy so it return truthy
join (" ,") using for spaces
slice can be used (slice(o,n)) will return o to n-1 values and return array datatype
when we use the spread operation on undefined it returns error  so assigning as moreorders=[],so it will return  finally the array
object plus emptry string will retunr array of objects
[4,5,6] toString()
 will return '4,5,6
 .join for spaces if needed
 it should return one line function
  find only checks the first element and return that element only
, if it doesnot have element matching the  condition it returns undefined value
, undefined .object  will return error cannot access so it can return values by use of ?? mark we can use the nullish coelescence it returns the type error
n every element matching the condition
  and accepts the predicate function
  code pen website can be used for coding practise sessions
  const getDishNamebyIds=(orders,...ids)=>{
  return orders
  filter ( order=>ids.include(order.id)
  .map(order=> Order,dishname))}
  .join("")
  }
  return ids
  return ids.map(order=>ids.includes(order.id)?order.dishname:"unknown dish")
  .join(",")
  return ids.map(order=>ids.includes(order.id)[0]?order.dishname:"unknown dish"--will use the fiter for all values will get returned
  empty array(0)- will return undefince
  Math.max(5,6,10)-- what will return  for array of numbers 
  since it returns not a number for three numbers
  spread and its use case 
  math.max(...arr)
  without use of spread operator
  Math.max(arr[0],arr[1])
  5.  const listOrders(...orders)=>orders=>
  orders.map(order=>$(order?.dishName??"unknown dish")($(order?.category?? "unknown  category')`))
  .join(",");
  interpolation  returns expressions it returns value
  general rules is important
  examples-imagination and boundaries for various examples could increase the boundaries must be extended
  an empty object must be enlarged -this is the idealogy -
  using box syntax and dot syntax
  it converts the key into variable
 by box syntax
   by using
  student[order.chef]="cool"
  to grow the key is enlarging lightly
  first step:- order.chef will be john doe for count ratings .length
  orders.ratings.length
  //dynamically growing the object
  let key='name'
  student[key]="vikki"
  for (let order of orders){
  let key=order.chef//"jon doe
  //dynamic=growing{]}
  student[key]=order.ratings.length
  //array of objects should use only reduce not map
  const getTotalRatingForChefs =(orders)=>{
  }

 using reduce:
 const getTotalRatingsForchefs1=(orders)=>{
  return orders.reduce(acc,order)=>({...acc,[order.chef]:order.ratings.lenght},{})// need to use the bracket out of the curly braces need to make javascript understand that it is not function it is an object
  //accumulator will get overridden for every values

 }
 table for understanding hte flow
 acc| order|result----- calculation ---justlikeliquid gold
  //reduce is powerful

// forEach can be used for looping but not returning
while map will return  
  
  
  refactoring or destructuring
  uses the object : dishname
  refactoring -the code must not change and to use as same as the above code
