# Topics for today presentation
  overflow  topics:
  - width  
  - by default overflow property is visible
  - content  and it can be croped and it can be made hidden
  - scrawl -overflow scrawl will include scrawl bar
  - generally div bar used in scroll bar is not good general practice
  - like example netflix scrolled bar is used for side scroll
  - overflow-x and overflow-y can be used for the image
  - hidden will cut the property
  - auto will enable to which side to take the scroll
  - on basis of image scroll
  - margin 0 ,auto
  - max width and scale must be straight down
  - rule followed with exception is right
  - like ar rahman broke the boundaries of elayaraja
  - gap can be used for  spaces between the images
  - width : auto or max is also same
  - overflow -x:scroll
  - only  x will scroll
  - inline block will add the images to next container 
  - grid can  also be used
  - flex is default by row only
  - wrap is used for one by one for the images
  - so overflow x scroll should be used
but being a part of the puzzle 
 - horizontal scrolling is used better than vertical scrolling  and used in day to day life 
 - javascript properties can replace the carousel property in bootstrap
 - grid and flex properties differences 
 - if mastered grid ,then layout skill will be mastered double
 - flex and grid can be used  complementary version
 - grid has 2d and flex has 1 d
 - grid has sees the reference of 
 previous  but flex doesnot sees the references as well
 - grid area has concepts in overlapping 
 - flex will be used on parent and grid also used in parent
 - but grid will not present the columns in side by side
 -grid template ratio is 1:1 ratio
 - third items will be present only in next row but maintains the same column 
 - ratio is 1:1  -fractional unit
 - 1 fr  - the same columns will be present in same ratio
 - flex will maintanin the  height but grid maintains the width as well
 - 1 fr 1 fr will divide equally
 - 1 fr 2fr 1 fr-1:2:1 
 - 12 column layout in bootstrap-css library -twitter bootstrap
 - 12 column layout must take 6  width each parts each 
 - designers -magazine came - dividing it in multiple for eg - 4 44,435 dividing the parts in multiple combinational parts -design layout lookwise 
 - repeat can be used for 4 times 1 fr as like 10 times 1 fr can be separated in terms of 1:10 ratio
 -  2 fr reoeat(2,1 fr) is equal to  2 fr 1 fr1 fr;
 - repeat (12 ,1 fr)
- grid can be used within flex as well used within grid also
- flex can be used for wraping all the  boxes but not in like order
- display grid will be used in accordance to the 1 fr as well but remaining space in accordance will also be used
- but gap maintains the order just like in assembly line despite the shrinkage
- 2d understands in grid but only 1 d in flex in column or row
- fixed in childs width and like flex you can fix the  box in cell as center in vertical wise like justify-center
-  align self and justify items  and align content can be used
 the type of centering the textwise
 -align item vertical wise since it does not have direction
 - certain things need to be done for self reliant- grid  to insert the overlapping the text with  the image
 - actually a grid area 
 - just like two boxes like content box and image box so it does the upskilling
  - 8 rem is equal to 16 pixels - 128 pixel
  - image from 3rd column to  column start to  column end -
 - basically 12345 for columns as well my content will need to come from 3 to 4 so it  comes overlapping of the content over the image
 - media query
 - min -width :800 px and max-width: 850 px
- overlapping using the numbers of columns 4 columns used for 1 fr 1 fr 8rem 1 fr;
-  so it will have 5 boxes  content box and image box to next  box
-   4 columns with 2 items need to off the remaining things while inspecting other items
-  so initiating to begin from column1 to column 5
-  1 to 2 in one column 
-  3 to 5 in other row 
 - 1 ,2 row numbers 
 - row must start with 1 ,2 fixing the 4 borders
 - all must he done within grid by fixes
 column1 ,row 1-row 2 column 2
 image and content can be done overlapped in accordance with the fixes
 - Shift +enter = for typing in the next lines
 - repeat ,autofit and Minmax
 -RAM technique
 -autofit is the algorithm
 - minmax (200 px,1 fr)
 - ram technique can be used to align as well as just like in flex but used in grid
 - mnemonic -memory patterns techniques
 - box shadow -getcssscan.com-  effect
 -dev tools
 -firefox tools -dev tools
  -blur and shadow -inspecting the tools  spread
  -variable of variables in real time examples
  -UI  areas
  -one line css and one line layout
  -references:chrome for dev -youtube
  - auto can be used for just spaces meant for content

  -webpack tool-
  - businee logic
  - minimum  -200  but entire width is 474 pixels  remaining 74 pixels is splitted to equal spaces -logic usage by first column and second column 
  -column width is important than box width
  -column width must be larger than the box or element width always
  -layout is easy in grid but difficult in flex
  -flexwrap - when squezed  -2d line can be used in grid 
  1 d can be used in flex
-parent is grid and child is flex
- wrap reverse is used 
-mediaquery
-css-overriding
-responsive-google-ranking-mobile first notion
-dimensions in different phones
- only desktop so it will say your browser is too small
- Mobile first -responsive-desktop work-usable
- checking with responsive  
- basics of css 
- 600 px -commented behaves like uncommented
> 600- 
-overridden based on specificity
stop -breakpoint- why need to animate
first minwidth and  then max width
-native- basic pixel and when  scaled it aligns with respective response
-for millions of devices how may breakpoints come?
when layout  will shrink or spacious keep the breakpoint
on each dimensions can be measured 
dimensions -when  we click on based on the mobile  phones we can find the responsiveness
use case on mobile and desktop  one  by one and one side one side
mobile is by default 
need to analogy when flex is made
and behaviour is overridden
 and breakpoint can be added random and fixed values
 flex wrap:wrap
 min width given 
 small screen: 1 column layout
 large screen: 3 column layout
 repeat 2 ,1 fr
 after 900 - 3 layout
 max width=1150 px
 fixed in container
 margin 0,auto.
 flex direction =column
 box used in column and content gets wrapped accordingly
 1,2,3 - but direction is column
 display  :none for container
