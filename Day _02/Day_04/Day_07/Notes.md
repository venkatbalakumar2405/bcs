compiler will change it into binary -compilation and execution phase
jit will do the execution while compiling
two phases execution
TDz-Temporal Dead zone-let ,const
one logic and many datas
:destructurinng  the  javascript
since function is used not to comment off
should use right names
rest operator in  collect in parameters
. and :
make it work and make it better
early return -used for one if without any else
corner case and edge case should be  handled and general case 
General scenario of business logic 
rare scenario must be handled
ticket scenario as well checking the gun elements  of terrorist is checking the rare case is early returns and sheilding 
destructuring uses dot and as well  used with default values
we can use the destructuring the parameters holding  and assignment but not rest operator
Boolean(null) and !!null are same
early  return
Boolean ( undefined ) will be false and !!undefined will be true
like dot chaining
it is called optional chaining  and it is also called defensive code
optional chaining is basically ?.
 cannot read properties of undefined
 y?.b?.abc if it is truthy  it will cut the undefined  if falsy it will return undefined
many optimized codes 2 and 3 codes also for one coding answer for any interviews
falsy chaining--->?. it will skip if 
highlight the words in presentation aspect ratio
question is needed
recording session is needed  for better rehearsal and presentations skills with designer sense of palette
devops team uses the cloud azure  end to end developer build and visualize for architecture
0 ,-0 and 0 n are  falsy
when a value converted into boolean and its reference 
traverse  for the   protect the actual need
checking the truthy  we use ?
only null and undefined will not be allowed
when x is not or undefined 
implicit return doesnot have keyword it can be used 
in arrow function is only applicable for implicit return function
when we use one argument we no need to use bracket
but we need bracket for two values
 \but we need braces for no arguments
 for one argument the bracket is optional 
 and multi arguments
 function(first class citizens) in javascript
 Function can be passed to another function
 when the type of  datatype of function will return only function
 non primitive datatypes are function and object
 type of class is also function
 node js was built for server
 under the hood  it will be class but it will be function
 call back function is used to say hello function  we use another word for say hello as hellomessage 
 so greeting is called as higher order function
 if a function takes another function as argument
 second condition a function should or can return another function
 when function does not have any name it is called as anonymous function 
 if a variable is assigned another function  is the third condition
 if function can be treated as a values it is a firstclass citizen
so value can be assigned in  a variable  and return from function so it similar to the properties of the value similar to function
value can be passed as argument
and value can be assigned
