# Task 2.0
# Explore and document the different ways in which a value can become NaN in JavaScript. Include code examples wherever applicable to demonstrate each case.
console.log('abc' - 5);     // NaN
console.log(undefined + 1); // NaN
console.log('hello' * 2);   // NaN
console.log(0 / 0);        // NaN
console.log(Infinity - Infinity); // NaN
console.log(Infinity * 0); // NaN
let x = NaN;
console.log(x + 10);   // NaN
console.log(x * 2);    // NaN
console.log(Number.isNaN(NaN));          // true
console.log(Number.isNaN("hello"));      // false
console.log(isNaN("hello"));             // true (but less reliable)
console.log(Number("abc"));     // NaN
console.log(parseInt("abc"));   // NaN
console.log(parseFloat("12abc")); // 12
console.log(parseFloat("abc12")); // NaN
console.log(Math.sqrt(-1));      // NaN (square root of negative number)
console.log(Math.log(-1));       // NaN (logarithm of negative number)
console.log(Math.acos(2));       // NaN (arccos out of range)
console.log(Math.asin(2));       // NaN (arcsin out of range)]
let x = NaN;
console.log(x + 10);   // NaN
console.log(x * 2);    // NaN

color will change means it is working
filler words must be avoided in other case 
hand gestures are powerful-redirect to the slight moments
avoid paragraphs in presentation ,but put in slides in diagram point of view alone only just as a reference
other than webpage toolbars like front ,back and reload button
browser engine assigns the work to js engine and rendering engine
rendering happens differently in each browsers
UI BACKEND-logic is stored and finally data storage cookies local storage ,session storage

 prettier extension has been installed and enabled
 configure document with pretiier  is used to format the code at best
 format on save and just click the checkbox only on saving
 open on html file and open with  live server and then inspect on console and dev tools
 corporate  culture on decorum
 if it is assigned as expression for variable
 ctrl+space and tab =autocomplete
 maths.abs (4-5) just like mod (9-5) returns the positive number
 math.ceil(4.2)--nearest greater whole number-5 onlyputting  the heighest number
 math.floor(4.8)-nearest lowest number
 if else for day 
 if else if for other days from monday to tuesday
 for if else can be one 
 elseif can be many  but last else
 Every line of statement and its terminated by; so if a statement returns a value then it is a expression

 dotchaining is used to do  process without  variable assigning
 depricated -need not use again since it is already used  so need to use another next optiohn
 the value cannot be changed in memory but the  variable is not altered
 string can be literal as it is immutable
 if any value is stored or replaced it will allocate separate memory while  shared memory when the same is  called by other values
 it is deprecated inorder used so time will be allowed to change the already used  variable in case for next version is released
 without error
 escape is used to bring the console in front of devtools as well the break points will be in bluecolor and will enable the breakpoint and disable the breakpoints
 shortcut check for  or true is if one true it will be executed
 shortcut check for and if anything is false
 DRY  -dont repeat yourself-principle- to identify bad code- your code is not repeat -make it work-codesmell-make it better 
 once you complete the code check the code whether it is dry
 balance will be maintained for quality for some levels of company and not go below the company levels as well the above the better the quality codes
 stages of coding   think in the policy to get better always" measure twice cut once"-german policy
 fail fast and learn fast is the policy of silicon valley policy
 REfactoring -code quality must be improved but the output should not be changed
 .git will be in hidden folde when it is used for initialized
 in projects savepoints can be used at many points in to load the project where it has been used again
 to restore the last modified things provided the savepoint is stored
 permanent id is automatically generated

 .git maintains the database
 if .git folder is deleted 
 rm -rf.git

 dont delet the .git  folder as the file is stored in local repositories and google drive like used as it is used in .git files is in hidden files
 give the message after plus for commit

 publish the branch to live private and public ,if published in public it
 when given access can be accessed in public  and private if it is not accessed
