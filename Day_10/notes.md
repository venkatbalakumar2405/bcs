//eslint.org
eslint find and fixes problems in your javascript code
it returns boolean 
anonymous  functions
it returns boolean
map is a function as well ir returns as  a arguement since it is a higher order function 
# Array of objects ---->it is a array of strings
//case 1:
const getTitle =(book)=>book.title;
const titles =books.map(getTitle);

//const titles=books.map(getTile());//
//case 2:
const titles1=books.map((book)=>book.title)'//HOF
//resuse type
//case 3:`this`
function getTile(book){
    return book.title;
}
const titles3=books.map(getTitle)//normal function
//case4: `this`
const getTitle =(book)=>{
    return book.title
}
//datatype is like signature//
//humble bragging and hypocrate
//testing can be done and upgraded scenario for gk what i shall bring to the table
//like software development in testlearning perspectives
//royallhumble is person who wins the last 
//table format for writing the programs will be the best use/
//first make the code work  and then make it better way usage
// conversion of implicit tostring while adding string to the lements of array 
//to string is called and [object object] will be returned
// " " will be converted into true since "" is non primitive and other is primitive and coercion willnot be allowed while using === since in array
//both the array will check the address so it will be false
//need to take and use scratch of each and every snippets
// apply in ratings  -the default value is comma
join can be used for using space as well 
//use reduce for alternative
//Jquery is predecessor of react
//theories must be  understand not to form out and use the logic when we use
//empty array need to be created and values to be pushed
//software life cycle

//devops-cloud engineer--hosting
//developers-testing-devops
//maintenance-support engineers
//stake -holders---higher responsibilities
// CTO-program manager--->signed by CTO officer
// brain storm - ideas into discussion
//website design -printrest,tribble,figma-design tool-=,sketch used by designers
//wireframes -status bar ,icon and navigation bar image is for x 
//after QA  approved,deployed successfully---version 1 and version 2  of development
//murkesh.com--client and support team--ticket raised -investigation
//priority -conversation   and created bug
//testing team--version 1.1 by deployment team
waterfall  and agile  model
//each phase takes one year time
//eg bridge  constrign -development-delivery-maintenance
//agile --1.1,1.uction
requirements-des001 within two weeks after each release  need to contact with client--logs will be recorded when used- first 10 k out of 10 lakhs people --next 1 lakhs --- 1 crore -ring release -trusted people-eg windows inside program like beta ,experimental things  can be happened within two sprints
--testing will also happen in sprints
--array.flat(2))-array of arrays will return array of arrays in single array
---just like map flat will be used to copy of original array
.flat()
the default value is 1
infinity can be used  for array of arrays
logic:-
1.fiction movies.
2.ratings
3.ratings above 7 if each element 
# software life cycle-ppt
map,filter,every  and flat1
To be improved:-
1.stop where you need to stress and say in order while presentation
2.first presentation in terms of  slide without mistake of pictures
3.second presentation -include the boxes  for every presentation  such like in declaration  block explained  for the function
4.speed lower down with  buffer of information
 Good :-
 1.Factual information was right
 2.Without any words presented in terms of diagrams
 ## 
 1. sprint planning

 2.Scrum - implementation of agile is scrum - 1 sprint is 14 days basically
 3.it takes only 2 hours - 14 days discussion about what need to be done
 4. design is floating resources - which sets to any tasks
 5.Devops 
 6.Bug feature and priority  need to be addressed  based on complexity
 7.Storypoints and time taken for each bug along with documentation as well unit test cases
 8.In according to the story points - we can category in accordance to the fibonacci series -round off
 9.Based on the days and hours - storypoints
 10.Will be questioned on task completion of stand up meeting-5 to 10 minutes -everyday -should not increase  30 minutes
 11.update - EOD  
 12.Blockers- dependancy on other teams
 13.overflow -will be added in next sprints -zero
 14.spill ones 
 15.sprint review- sprint retrospective
 16. take aways from feedback
 17. everything makes sense when you are connecting the dots  backwards
 18. Calligraphy
 19. invention of times new roman by steve jobs
 20. take aways from retrospective to implement in  mac to windows
 21.What can be  done - sprint retrospective
 21 a) output need to be done in  presentation
 22.humble bragging -  sprint review  -need to be done and noted to be presented for each modules and tasks completion-depends on the 1 story point
 23.Please stop by - need to come to cabin with pausing the work
 24.Unified -visualize
 kanvan board-- backlog-sprint -ideas from PM
 25. jira is costly while github is free of cost for projects
 26.backlog -tickets collection
 27. Create a menu page
 28. ### dosa varities
 -photo
 -price-
 -rating
 -button
 -add
 -remove
 - Dev board
 29 .ticket will be created
 30.kanban
 31.wireframe used by program manager

 11.-- rough estimation -medium size like tshirt sizes in backlog  -- will be assigned story points in the jira sprint will be added in terms of fibonacci series- in terms of values  and feasibility 
 12.po -high priority assigned taks 
 13.LGTM-looks good to me
 14. sprint started -sprint closure
 15.Ad hoc tickets - added with the help of manager without planning
 stake holders-night 10 to 9 -mexican style -indian style
 16. sprint view  30 storypoints insights- burn down chart 
 17.productivity - traced by CTO dashboard 
 18.Adhoc will denote the hike of the sprints in terms of bugs assigned in terms of ad hoc --jump---overflow nearest to four value
 19.bitbucket like github
20 spike- ad hoc
21 -burn up chart
