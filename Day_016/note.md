# Position
- Static.
- Relative.:from where it was already it has to moved to 10px from relative of its postition
- Absolute.
- fixed.
- Sticky
- relative is a good thief like overlap and it leaves a gap as well
- absolute given in the element while inspected
- nearest relative place it will hide
- while in relative the gap will be present
- while given absolute the gap will not come in between
- relative should be given as parent while both relative and absolute are given under sam div
- given ul is relative 
- when overlap is done it is obsolute only
- pseudo element and pseudo condition
- before and after decoration element
- psuedo class :: double colon 
- nth condition and position absolute
- container and notification given so need to give absolute of which image gets moved

- static ,absolute and relative
- paragraph -
- fixed -bottom and top center  can be moved 
- but in case of absolute the when scrolled the  content goes away it will not get fixed
- transform x -50  x/2 width  of the container translate
- paragraph width : transform:translateX(-50%_) because of maths
- left  transform:translateX(-50%)-logic application ahead of syntax
- questions for investigation of how extensible things iam aware of
- smart guiding as per  tracking the  interview based on known things
- transform: translatex(-50%) translate(-50%)-then need to say and apply
- transform: translate (-50%,-50%)- shortcuts 
- sticky is an hybrid property of static and  will be property based fixed  when parameters are given 10 px
