# Day-1 -intro
# introduction to  browser
### what language does the browser understand?
>Note:Although chrome is built on c++ it does not understand it
>firefox was built on Rust language 
-CSS
-HTML
-JS   
#Multiple types of Engine
-Rendering 
- Parses HTML AND CSS
(nested)
-chrome :Blink
-JS ENGINE
-parses javascript
-chrome :v8
# SHORTCUTS
- alt+ UP-->MOVE LINES UP AND DOWN
# BACKTICK`
- `alt +â¬†`  ->move lines up and down
-. to convert into dev in github
- win+.`->Emoji

## web application -dynamic response
## website-static response
# # browser using 
## kotlin -android
# ios mobile-shift
#web app is not  needed to download ,don't need to update and works on cross platform
# three layer architecture
# Front -End ,back-ENd,database
# chrome-javascript,react script,backend-flask-python,sql
#html-skeleton,css-makeup,javascript-brain
#css-developer tools -rightclick-inspect-devtools-network-refresh the screen-blcok request url of css - to remove css
# unblock url-css
#json are medium of data transfer
#in front end react js and angular may be differ but the backend will not change
#go- developed by  google
#loose coupling to separate front end and back end
#javascript is basic and react 
#webpack plus babel is the translator to change the react js
#code reusablity 
#developer experience dx
#user experience ux
#foundation is similar to javascript as hammer  and hammer for react js
# index .html is the request  to server and client
# server is a pc
# google is a html file by request and response cycle
# fetch resources 
# Decompress,parse/compile ,render
# Domain name system
# square space ,hosting ,godaddy
# phising attack for facebook.in
# authorized  squatting 
# contact as like as DNS as like ip address.
# from ip address to google ip address.
# ip address is like  a mobile number ipv4  and ipv6
# assigning every grain of sand like ipv 6 addresses
# public and private static and dynamic
# vpn virtual private number  ISP  
# private line like since it is permanent  and static is costlier
# dynamic 
# public and private  ip ,public ip is assigned as well private ip  while private ip is assigned from router
# DNS -google has ip address public and privateip is also assigned for internal 
# mac address - physical address on network adapter 
# vpn is connected to another computer and 
# linked in profile and git hub profile  and also recap of afternoon sessions
# we were changing some css files in websites  as a takeaway
# war between IE and Mozila firefox
# inbuild and default by microsoft for IE and netscape was for price
# brand 
# toolbars and IE was bad user experience
# white labelling,chromium based browsers
# webpack and babble will come to convert the javascript flask 
# dx -developer experience will be better in react
# inspect-network -devtools-network panels-css -elements panel
# domain name providers
# domain name server
# automize will seek the response 
# public ip will act as passport and private ip will act as adhaar
# CDN Server---keeping the copy in multiple places
# will connect with ISP 
# ip behind google address 
# when :80 port 80 is accessed 
# RJ45 is mean't for ethernet port
# software  access the port as like service
# task manager-process
# running program is a process
# web server seems to run in another computer in 80 port or 443 port
# 22 port another computer can be controlled
# 440 port https is secured connection
# Each service runs in the port
# default port services.
# File transfer protocol like google drive like ftp server port must be opened 
# putty is used for Secure shell (SSH)
# DNS convertso domain name into ip address
# both client and server has an ip address
# router setticng can be used any ip address the speed of downloading
# mac address - can be used to set the  ip address from router 
# Connecting with another router wan port and lan port
# coloured port is wan port and second router will work as switch
# transmission control protocol
# connection  is stable -TCP handshake-Three way handshake handshake is inititiated
# synch hi Ack Hi ,Ack ack HI
# UDP works with live streaming.
# real time example is whatsapp for TCP
# smtp is tcp
# UDP IS AN EXAMPLE OF TEAMS
# FOR THREE HANDSHAKE AFTER STABLE CONNECTION
# FOR EACH UDP 
# SUBMARINEE OFC CABLES OPTICAL FIBER CABLE
# 8th layer is important as total internal reflection 
# each country and government
# paid for maintanence and infrastructure
# unicast for one way communication
# broadcast- livestream
# multicast- for two way communication
# smaller packets of entire file 1024 mb
# if pocket loss happens it will chose another route
# certain rules to be followed for packets
# HTTP 0.9 1991 ,HTTP 1.0 ,HTTP 2.0  2015
# 6 CONNECTIOHNS  FILES CAN BE SEND IN HTTP 1.1 PERSISTANCE CONNECTIONS
# HTTP 1.1  BUNCH OF RESPONSE CAN BE SENT
#  HEAD OF THE LINE BLOCKING  - WHEN DELAY HAPPENS
# HTTP 2.0 AND HTTP 3.0 WHAT HAPPENED
# HTTPS -SECURITY CERTIFICATE WILL BE AVAILABLE  IN THE THREE 
# INDEX ,CSS AND JAVASCRIPT THE FILES IF PUT INTO WEB SERVER IT IS CALLED HOSTING
# SO THE CERTIFICATE IS VALID  FROM HOSTING
# THE 500 KB MUST BE THE  LENGTH OF THE HOSTING AND FREE  FOR HOSTING INCASE OF DOMAIN NAME PURCHASE
# CERTIFICATE MUST BE VALID WITHIN THE ISSUED TIME
# HTTP 2.0 WLL BE PROVIDED 
# DOMAIN NAME  AND HOSTING (1MB) AND CERTIFICATE WILL BE ISSUED AND IT WILL BE SCORED IN REALITY AS  2KEYS IN PHYSICAL
# COLIMN IN PROTOCOL TO IDENTIFY AS HTTP 2
# THERE IS 9 MB RESOURCES AND 5.O MB IS THE COMPRESSED AND MOST OF THE  IMAGES ARE  CARRIES  MOST WEIGHT OF THE IMAGES
# HTTP STATUS CODE
# 200 - SUCCESS AS LIKE DIAL TONE -ENGAGE
# 404 - ERROR
# 400- SERIES ON MISTAKE DONE BY CLIENTS
# 500 -SERIES ON MISTATE DONE NY SERVER
# 300 -REDIRECT  TO ZOMATO FOR UBER EATS
# 100 - INFORMATIONAL
# ONLY BACK END DEVELOPER WILL 401 -UNAUTHORIZED
# METHODS-CRUD
# CREATE READ UPDATE AND DELETE
# ONLY 4 OPTIONS ARE DONE 
# CREATE-POST METHOD
# READ-GET METHOD
# UPDATE-PUT METHOD
# DELETE -DELETE METHOD
# ONLY GET METHOD MUST WILL BE USED WHEN LOGIN TO GET THE DATA
# DATABASE POINT OF VIEW
# RECORD WILL BE CREATED
# COLLECTION WILL BE HANDLED ON BASIS OF CREATION OF SHOW TIME SO RECORD WILL BE CREATED
# ONLY RECORDS WILL BE CREATED FOR UNIQUE ENTRIES
# POST TRANSACTION  BASIS WILL BE COUNTED BASICALLY POST OPERATION
# THE LIKE OPERATION IN INSTA IS  POST OPERATION SINCE IT WILL TELL THE NAMES OF THE PERSONS ALONG WITH COUNT  SO IT IS POST OPERATION
# THE POST IS DELETED WILL BE BASED ON THE PUT OPERATION ON FACEBOOK
# FACEBOOK --DELETED  BUT THE ANSWER IS UPDATE THAT IS PUT METHOD  ONLY THE OPERATIONS WILL BE TURNED ON THE DATA TO YES OPERATION ALLOWING AGAIN THE DATA TO REINSERT WITH ANOTHER NAME,SINCE THE DATA IS REGISTERED IT WILL BE STORED IN DATABASE
