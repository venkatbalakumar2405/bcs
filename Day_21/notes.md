# SPA-Single Page application
- spa -single page application
- mpa -multiple page application
- duplicate 
- common things can be done static  -concept of spa- only dynamic changes need to undergo changes
- mpa -data exchange currency -html
- inner html in javascript - spa -popularized by react js -json will be fetched and need to change the content in DOM -by json.queryselector-inner html likely in code pen  fetch case program
-  replacing query selector in javascript in react js -AJAX was Asynchronorus javascript call similar to fetch in xml previously then to json format 
- spa only the particular blocks will be  loaded with time while for traditional websites will load entire page after blank page being loaded 
- without blanck screen being loaded it is power of spa
- sequential experience (web) and fluid experience (mobile)
- disadvantages of spa
- initial load time will be larger or larger in case of spa .
- code split- which needs to be loaded while remaining rest will be loaded in background-like lazy loading and prefetching
-  first intention of spa will be taking time but will be loaded soon
# Reusability
-  Build once and reusable many times
- Logic part was in javascript =>Logic part +UI=>components in ReactJS
- if one cards can be built - can be reused likely in components -bigger concept reused in angular framework from react js
- exceptional cases -logic+UI->rolling like feature for component
- logical perspectives-one card at a time then author which changes the author's image  and as well date and time 
- technique like hover and examples of event handler  can be used  because need to reused like in ragav sir website -category search using the various types of search component within component -logical wise what need to be altered are considerred as each component
- 2 dimensions in terms of grid used in css using spec and flex wrap  columnwise  but here in raghav sir template it must be used rowwise 
- mansonry layout-library used   -sticky notes  based on dashboard like wise  was build in raghavsir website -observarions- 
-pinterest
- https://babeljs.io/
- -jsxs will have codes of document.create element-js only changes html codes
- observations done by babel  and tryout to convert into javascript - sandbox behind it creates the html conversion just like liveserver
- observations - view page source - to get the code alone just like inspect 
- used like in react also 
- used to start by app
- link to disable the javascript 
-chrome settings.javascript- do disable- and observe the changes -
