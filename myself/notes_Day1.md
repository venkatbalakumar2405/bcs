undefined will be returned  when the indexes is accessed out of ranges in array
right click  to change the word to implement in all code areas90o
both array and object is considered as object
the type of object is object
every key of the array is basically s ined
array is  a short cut of object.'

 //baseaddress +0 -is the starting address of the memory for array-reference 
 //var,const,let are for array are same
 //primitive types store value
 // non primitive types store address
 // methods in array
 //t1.push(300)

# Answer
 A
 Array destructuring
 ---unpacking
 cont [t1,t2]=[100,200]
console.log(t1,t2,t3);
default value  will be assigned when the  undefined
console.log will be 80
holes can be in first and as well in middle ,and values will be assigned
object is key based and array is index based
not defined is an error  and  undefined is an  value
