if will express true or false
cool is a string
it returns a string
so whether it will  return true or false
if a value converts into  a boolean which results in true it is called truthy
if a value converts into false it is called falsy
javascripts contains 8 falsy value
falsy mdn
true will print awesome
 not included it will return falsy mdn
 truthy if it is included in  table

 const csk={
    captain :"MSD",
    color:"yellow"
 }
 empty object .cool will return undefined
 undefined .abc will return  cannot read properties of undefined
 case 2:
 console.log(csk.stats.win)-- if stats is not given
 cannot read properties of undefined
 cannot read properties of null
 if null is assigned
 Data not found
  only 5 wins
empty string returns the falsy so the result unknown will be returned 
//nullish coalescing ??
coalescing-->null and undefined  are falsy and remaining are true
null and undefined only  returns the falsy values

error should not come  so it is an collection of code to avoid error error contain it is called defensive code
//binary opertor since it operates on two operands
Arithmetic or mathematical operator
Relational operator
logical operator
unary operator
++-increment operator and decrement operator
! 
ternary operator
1 ?:
operand1?operand2?operand3

Arrow function
implicit return -it converts one line codes
const sum=(n1+n2)=>n1+n2
shorthand -nullish coelescence
